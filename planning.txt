Steps:

T1: Neural network object and node object with hard threshold
		- NeuralNetwork and NeuralNetworkNode objects
		- allow json initialization of neuralnet?
		- store all nodes in NeuralNetwork as list
		- Where to save connections?
			- on each node NO
			- separate connection table YES

T2: Sigmoid activation functions
	- simple perceptron learning
	- learning
		- single layer feed-forward neural network

T3: multi layer feed-forward
T4: multilayer back propogation
