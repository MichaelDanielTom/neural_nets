Steps:
	- Implement neural network object and node object with hard threshold
		- NeuralNetwork and NeuralNetworkNode objects
		- allow json initialization of neuralnet?
		- store all nodes in NeuralNetwork as list
		- Where to save connections?
			- on each node
			- separate connection table

		
	


	- sigmoid activation functions
	- simple perceptron learning
	- learning
		- single layer feed-forward neural network
		- multi layer feed-forward
		- multilayer back propogation
